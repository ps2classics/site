# PS2 Classics

A site dedicated to PS2 Classics on PS3 information.

## Goals:
- Display compatibility information in a user-friendly way, sourced from the PS Dev Wiki.
- Catalog games that are currently missing data.
- Promote testing and the creation of config files to fix broken titles.

The ultimate end goal of this project is to create a community-driven movement to complete PS2 compatibility on PS3 and improve it to the best experience possible.
